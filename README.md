A fork of oemer by @BreezeWhite which removes the command line part and replaces them with a simple python function to start it. You need to look in oemer->ete.py. 
This file contains the main() function (very last line). 

What is oemer
Oemer is an Optical Music Recognition system build on top of deep learning models and machine learning techniques.
Able to transcribe on skewed and phone taken photos. The models were trained to identify *Western Music Notation*, which could mean the system will probably not work on transcribing hand-written scores or other notation types.
